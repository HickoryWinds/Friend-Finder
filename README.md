## Friend-Finder

#### Friend-Finder is an app that takes answers given by the user and finds their most compatible friend by comparing their answers to those that are in the database. The app finds the first friend that whose answers are closest to the user and display the friends name and photo. The app uses node.js, javascript, html, css, and bootstrap technologies.

#### When the user arrives at the website, the welcome page is presented.
